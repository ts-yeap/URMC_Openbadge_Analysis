Data folder.
Please place your data files here, or you can place it somewhere else as long as you modify the data input derectory in 
"./URMC_CTSI_openbadge_analysis/Data_Cleaning.py". 
```
### URMC_CTSI_openbadge_analysis
```
Python 3 file forder.
Please see the below "Codebook" for more details. 
```

## Codebook
### Preprocessing (Preprocessing.py)
```
Preprocess input txt data files. 
```
### Data_Clearning (Data_cleaning.py)
```
Clean data and manipulate data into the structures we need for futher analysis. 
```
### Signal Strength Distribution (signal_strength_distribution.py):
```
We generated histograms for the distribution of signal strength with count as frequency. We also created dynamic signal strength 
frequency change in a video format which is available through a share-only link on Youtube.

Please see the below "Codebook" for more details. 
```
### Member Interaction Distribution (member_to_member_function.py)
```
At the beginning of the script, it cleans out the badgeâ€™s information that was not worn by attendees. This script generates 
heatmaps about the member to member interaction given any time period. For the different time periods, the user needs to pick a 
threshold for this session based on the signal strength distribution histograms. Part of the script also generates heatmap 
interaction distribution between members with the same background fields and members with different background fields. The script 
also generates p-values for the statistical hypothesis test.
